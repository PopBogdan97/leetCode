//! You are assigned to put some amount of boxes onto one truck. You are given a 2D array boxTypes,
//! where boxTypes[i] = [numberOfBoxesi, numberOfUnitsPerBoxi]:
//!
//!     numberOfBoxesi is the number of boxes of type i.
//!         numberOfUnitsPerBoxi is the number of units in each box of the type i.
//!
//!         You are also given an integer truckSize, which is the maximum number of boxes that can
//!         be put on the truck. You can choose any boxes to put on the truck as long as the
//!         numberÂ of boxes does not exceed truckSize.
//!
//!         Return the maximum total number of units that can be put on the truck.
//!
//!
//!
//!         Example 1:
//!
//!         Input: boxTypes = [[1,3],[2,2],[3,1]], truckSize = 4
//!         Output: 8
//!         Explanation: There are:
//!         - 1 box of the first type that contains 3 units.
//!         - 2 boxes of the second type that contain 2 units each.
//!         - 3 boxes of the third type that contain 1 unit each.
//!         You can take all the boxes of the first and second types, and one box of the third
//!         type.
//!         The total number of units will be = (1 * 3) + (2 * 2) + (1 * 1) = 8.
//!
//!         Example 2:
//!
//!         Input: boxTypes = [[5,10],[2,5],[4,7],[3,9]], truckSize = 10
//!         Output: 91
//!
//!
//!
//!         Constraints:
//!
//!             1 <= boxTypes.length <= 1000
//!                 1 <= numberOfBoxesi, numberOfUnitsPerBoxi <= 1000
//!                     1 <= truckSize <= 106
